# CS 3300 PROJECT 2

## Eric Sun, Heather Zhu, Theodore Carrel

A project made Spring 2019 in Cornell's CS 3300 Data Visualization class. Made using javascript, D3, and a bit of python for data preprocessing. View the visualization here: https://suneric98.github.io/cs3300_project2/. 

Code was split between the three of us, a better representation of how the code was divided can be found here: https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/tjc233/project2-3300. I merely moved the code over to my repository for convenience.
